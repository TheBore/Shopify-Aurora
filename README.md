# Shopify Aurora
### A web application made for both buying and selling clothes online.
<br/>

With the help of this web application, depending on your goals you are able to do one of two things:

1. Sell your clothes as a shop, or even as a one-man shop user!
2. Search and buy any kind of clothes you are able to find!
